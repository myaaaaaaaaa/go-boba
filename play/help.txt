Plays back terminal "animations" from a text file.

This program reads a text file and displays it to the terminal. It pauses on
specific sequences of characters to create a playback effect. This allows
specially prepared plain text files to act as animations.

The program pauses on:
  - Newlines
  - ANSI clear screen escape codes

The input file is read from standard input if no file is provided.
